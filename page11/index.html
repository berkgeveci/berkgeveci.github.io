        VTK issue hackathon
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>On October 2nd 2014, we held a hackathon to reduce the number of issues in the VTK bug
tracker in anticipation of VTK&#39;s migration to a new bug tracker (as part of migrating to
Gitlab probably). We also hope to come to a place where we triage bugs early and keep
the issue tracker relatively clean.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hackathon.jpg" alt="VTK issue hackathon"></p>

<p>Here is the attendance list as far as I can tell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ken Martin</li>
<li>Bill Lorensen</li>
<li>Will Schroeder</li>
<li>Bill Hoffman</li>
<li>Berk Geveci</li>
<li>Shawn Waldon</li>
<li>Chuck Atkins</li>
<li>Marcus Hanwell</li>
<li>Utkarsh Ayachit</li>
<li>Andy Bauer</li>
<li>Ben Boeckel</li>
<li>Dave DeMarle</li>
<li>Cory Quammen</li>
<li>David Gobbi</li>
<li>David Cole</li>
<li>Sean McBride</li>
</ul>

<p>It was awesome working alongside these brilliant folks to improve VTK. Of
course, we had to occasionally poke fun at the original developers (all 3 were
there!) and blame them for some of the issues; all in good fun.</p>

<p>Before the hackathon, we had 189 open bugs. After the hackathon, we have 118 bugs.
But that&#39;s not all, there is still a lot of code in Gerrit review. So if we include
those, we are down to 91 bugs! So we closed a whopping 98 bugs in 1 day. To be fair,
we closed many bugs because they were already fixed or contained feature requests that
we didn&#39;t want to implement but we also fixed a large number of real issues. To see the 
list of bugs that we closed, check out <a href="http://tinyurl.com/lrznr6w">this link</a> and look
at the bugs that were closed around 10/2 2014. This list will grow as the changes
currently in Gerrit review makes into master. The icing on the cake is that we have
very little dashboard issues that resulted from the hackathon. Those should be resolved
very soon.</p>

<p>After the hackathon, some of us went to <a href="http://saltyspub.com/">Salty&#39;s</a> for some
grub and beers. Overall very successful and fun hackathon. I am already looking forward
to the next one.</p>
